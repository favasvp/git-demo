When working with Git, you might want to track the changes made to a specific file—who changed it, when, and why. Luckily, Git makes this super easy!

📂 View History of a Specific File
To see all commits that affected a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log <filename>
✅ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log script.py
🔍 Want More Detail?
Here are some handy variations:

Show code changes in each commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log -p script.py
Show a summary of changes (lines added/removed):

bash
Copy
Edit
git log --stat script.py
Compact view (1 line per commit):

bash
Copy
Edit
git log --oneline script.py
Limit to the last 5 commits:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log -n 5 script.py
🔎 Bonus: Who Changed What?
Use git blame to see who last modified each line:

bash
Copy
Edit
git blame script.py
