[200~📝 Understanding Git Branches: A Beginner’s Guide
If you're learning Git, one concept that might sound confusing at first is branches. But branches are actually one of Git’s most powerful features.

🌱 What is a Git Branch?
Think of a branch as a copy of your project where you can safely make changes, add new features, or fix bugs—without touching the original code.

The main branch (usually called main or master) is your production-ready code.

✨ Why Use Branches?
Avoid breaking the main code

Work on multiple features at once

Collaborate easily with others

Review changes before merging

🧪 Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/login-page
Now you're on a new branch. You can build the login page here without affecting the main code.

Once done, push the branch and open a Pull Request (PR) to get it reviewed and merged.

✅ Summary
Branches let you experiment, test, and improve without risk. Whether you're working alone or on a team, branching keeps your workflow clean and safe.

Happy coding! 🚀
